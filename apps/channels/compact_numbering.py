"""Compact channel numbering helpers.

The per-group `compact_numbering` custom_property is opt-in. When enabled
on a ChannelGroupM3UAccount, the group's auto-created channels get packed
contiguously into the group's [start, end] range:

  * Visible without channel_number override: assigned sequentially
  * Hidden without channel_number override:  channel_number set to NULL
    (released; the slot becomes available for visible channels)
  * Override-pinned (any visibility): untouched; the override's
    channel_number is treated as a global reservation that other channels
    skip when packing

Used by sync_auto_channels (full-pack pass), the post_save Channel signal
(single-channel unhide), the bulk-edit endpoint (bulk unhide), and a
manual per-group re-pack endpoint.

Trade-off the user opts into: channel numbers may shift when hide / unhide
state changes. To pin a number through hide/unhide cycles, set a
channel_number override - the override is honored as a reservation.
